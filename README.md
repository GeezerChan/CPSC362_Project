##### Snake Game Project

- The name of the game is *EmagEkans*
- 1-player


Goal:
The goal of this project is to recreate the Snake game or making my own version of it.
The Snake game is a popular game that many people have recreated or made a version of their own. 
Whether it's imperfect or imperfect, I will try my best to attempt what others have tried to attempt. 


Concept: 
Winning by high score or completely filling out the play area, 
the objective of the Snake game is to control a snake character that moves in only the x-axis and y-axis. 
Using the restricted movement to maneuver around a square field and collect an item. 
Trying not to hit yourself or the borders of the square field, 
collecting the item could give points and will make your snake character longer each time. 
The longer the snake becomes, the easier is it to run into yourself.
