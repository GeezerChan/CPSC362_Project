##### Snake Game Project

- The name of the game is "*EmagEkans*"
- 1-player


Project Goal:
The goal of this project is to recreate the Snake game or making my own version of it.
The Snake game is a popular game that many people have recreated or made a version of their own. 
Whether it's imperfect or imperfect, I will try my best to attempt what others have tried to attempt. 


Game Objective:
The objective of the Snake game is to control a snake character that moves in only the x-axis and y-axis.
Collecting the items that appear on the screen to progress and extend your snake character. while also 
avoid running into the border of the playfield and avoid running into yourself. Winning by high score
or completely filling out the play area.


Game Win condition:
- Collecting all of the items and making your snake fill up the entire playboard.
- Personal score to beat.

Game-Over conditions:
- Colliding with yourself. When the head of the snake colldies with the body/tail.
- Colliding with the borders of the playzone.


Game restrictions:
- When moving in a straight direction, can only turn left or right.
